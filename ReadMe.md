Design Choices
1. Minimalist Approach
I opted for a clean and minimal design to keep the focus on the content. The layout is simple with no excessive decorative elements, ensuring a professional and organized appearance.
2. Green Theme
I chose a green color scheme as it conveys growth, balance, and harmonyâ€”qualities I wish to reflect in my work. It's also easy on the eyes, promoting a calm and focused browsing experience.
3. User-Friendly Navigation
The navigation menu on the left sidebar provides quick access to key sections of the site (Home, About, Projects, Contact). These icons make navigation intuitive for all users.


Problems Encountered
1. Responsiveness Issues
One major challenge I encountered was ensuring the layout adjusts properly across different screen sizes. Certain elements, such as text and images, either overlapped or misaligned on smaller devices.
2. Image Scaling
Keeping the profile image and text properly aligned while maintaining visual balance was tricky, especially on wider or smaller screens.

Solution Implemented
1. I employed CSS media queries. This allowed me to modify styles based on screen size and ensure elements like text, buttons, and images look great on all devices.
2. By setting maximum width and height for images and employing flexible font sizes (rem or em units), I was able to make the design more adaptive
